        <p>
          I am playing cricket professionally for 8 years now. I started back in
          2017 before i got admitted in BKSP, which is the number 1 sports
          institute in bangladesh and only institution of this category in asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can't say i'm quite successful in cricket so far though i played
          district and division level. But after learning cricket for 6 years in
          BKSP, now its time to play for different teams in different
          tournaments and make career out of it. I'm just looking forward to do
          better and keep going.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now I'm just trying to play Dhaka League, which is the only path
          to walk to the top levels.

        <p>
          Along with cricket I kept in touch with study so well that it gifted
          me so much. When the exam comes nearby, like 1 months or so, I only
          study to do well in the exams. That month of hard work and being
          conscious about other factors throughout the year pays me off and
          eventually gives a descent or good result.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got 4.89 in HSC by doing that and finally in the admission test of
          Dhaka University i did well and got the chance to get admitted.
        </p>
        <p>Now, I am studying Sociology in Dhaka University.</p>

        <p>
          Now, this part is completely off course, I mean it not counted. This
          started back in the corona time when everybody was in home. I had an
          inborn curiousness for computer things. I am always curious to figure
          out how things work and function.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, when I got a computer in my hand it expressed at its best. That
          happened in the lockdown time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got a computer which was a dual core pcðŸ˜…. As you can understand a
          dual core pc with 2 gigs of ram can barely run let alone doing some
          real work on it. But instead it was good for me. Being not that good
          and less expensive gave me the opportunity to try out things and do
          experiments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then i came to know linux. And it expanded the capability of my pc as
          well as my learning curve with a whole bunch of curiosity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned the system, how it works, commands and all that other
          stuffs.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I started using linux, now my pc is a bit faster and i bought a
          ssd, now its even faster giving its optimal best performance. So i
          could done some real work in my pc now. It is then when i started
          learning web development.
